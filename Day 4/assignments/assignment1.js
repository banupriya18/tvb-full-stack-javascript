/**
 * Write a program that logs to the console
 * 3 times. One of the logs should be delayed by
 * 3 seconds (or 3000ms).
 * 
 * For example;
 * 
 * console.log('one');
 * console.log('two');
 * console.log('three');
 * 
 * In the above example, all 'one', 'two' and 'three'
 * will get logged one after the other without any
 * delay.
 * 
 * This assignment requires you to implement some function
 * that delays one of the logs to be printed by 3000ms
